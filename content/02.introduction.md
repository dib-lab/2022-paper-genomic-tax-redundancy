## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Introduction goes here.

Nasko et al. (2018) showed that increasing database size substantially
degraded classification accuracy with Kraken, a k-mer based approach
that offers high recall [@doi:10.1186/s13059-018-1554-6]. Recently,
Portik et al. showed that a different k-mer based approach, sourmash,
achieved both high recall [@doi:10.1101/2022.01.31.478527] and high
precision. Our proximal motivation in this work is to understand why.

Our larger motivation is to explore the information content that can
be used by k-mer-based techniques such as Kraken and sourmash for
genomic and taxonomic classification of metagenomes. This is
particularly relevant as reference collections grow larger and include
many genomes that belong to the same species. Strain-resolved
metagenomic classification is likely to grow in importance as well.

We seek a generative solution that will guide analysis approaches in the
future. In particular, we are interested in defining metrics that can
help characterize approaches at a theoretical level so that we can understand
the limitations of current approaches and improve future approaches to reach
maximal use of available information.

KMCP intro makes lots of good points. Note combinatoric statement in SBT paper. Make point that FracMinHash is picking independent k-mers.

More points to make, somewhere:

* you can use combinatorics with more than just FracMinHash. All k-mers, or seeds (like BLEND), or ...
