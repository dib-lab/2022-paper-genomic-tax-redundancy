## Abstract {.page_break_before}

A central challenge in bacterial genomics and taxonomy is that genomic
databases are increasingly large and contain redundant content.  This
impacts the accuracy of taxonomic profilers and metagenome analysis
tools that rely on these databases.  Here, we probe the practical and
theoretical limits of genomic identification and taxonomic
classification by exploring _unicity distance_ and _Shannon
entropy_. Unicity distance provides an estimate of how many k-mers are
required to precisely identify a single reference genome from within a
database, while Shannon entropy of k-mers describes the
informativeness of a k-mer for taxonomic classification.  We show that
approximately 30% of genomes in GTDB rs207 have infinite unicity and
that 99% of k-mers can resolve taxonomy at the species, genus, or
family level.  We conclude that unicity distance and Shannon entropy
provide simple metrics for evaluating genomic redundancy and taxonomic
coherence of large genomic reference databases.
